    Find the beginning of a synchronization sequence in data.

    This function finds the beginning and the end of a synchronization sequence
    by computing the cross-correlation of the synchronization sequence
    and the data.

    From version 0.4.27, the behavior of this function is a little different:

    First we find a first approximate of the synchronization location by computing
    the correlation of the envelope of the signal and the envelope of the synchronization
    (which is a rectangle function). A more computationally expensive, but
    accurate, search is then performed by cross-correlating the signal with
    the synchronization sequence.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray): the data from where the synchronization should be found.
        synchro_obj (SynchronizationSequence): instance of the class that generates the synchronization sequence.
        use_abs (bool, optional): use the absolute value of the synchronization in the second search. Defaults to True.
        resample (float, optional): the optional resample to apply to the synchronization sequence. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: tuple including the beginning and the end of the synchronization sequence.
